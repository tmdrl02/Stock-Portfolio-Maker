I developed a Python-based tool leveraging web scraping techniques to extract key financial metrics, including PER
and ROA, from Naver Finance for stocks listed on the Korean market.
It was implemented with Joel Greenblattâ€™s Magic Formula investment strategy, filtering out companies with extremely low PER
while assigning higher scores to companies with lower PER and higher ROA.
It Generates a stock investing portfolio based on calculated total scores, facilitating informed investment decisions
by prioritizing companies with stronger financial performance relative to their peers.
